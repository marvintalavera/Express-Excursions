# MERN_project
This is Our Mern project Express Excursions. It is travel blog where you are able to upload reviews of destinations and be
able to read the reviews of others. It is supposed to allow you to login and post your own reviews but that is still currently
in the process of being worked on. I (Marvin Talavera) did all of the front end and router pages, so that is layout to how things
are structured when you see the website throughout its "home, about, destinations, posts, and login" pages. The rest of the team
worked on the backend such as plugging in the website to a database such as MongoDB.

the app is launched by forking the repo and launching "npm start" once cd into "mern_project".
